	abstract = {Many studies regarding growth in diameter at breast height (D) in trees suffer from several problems, including heteroscedasticity, temporal autocorrelation and very low statistical adjustments. In growth ring studies, growth models are sometimes omitted, presenting only a mean curve or smoothings, while studies that use models often do not address the above mentioned problems. For these reasons, this paper proposes a new approach to the classical modeling of D = f(t), where t is age (years), using the logarithmic transformation of the relative growth rate ln(1/D)(dD/dt) = ln f(D, A),where A is the asymptote of D based on the differential growth rate model of von Bertalanffy. High statistically significant adjustments for Cedrela odorata (ME = 65\%, model efficiency, ME, an analogous to R2 but for non-linear regressions), and Juglans neotropica (ME = 78\%) were obtained and met all regression assumptions. These equations were integrated to obtain D = f(t) for both species, followed by self and independent validation. Based on these equations, different life history and silviculture traits were calculated for both species. This procedure does not appear to have been previously used in the study of tree growth.},

	url = {https://www.afrjournal.org/index.php/afr/article/view/1722},
	abstract = {In the Colombian Caribbean, 44 permanent sampling plots (PSPs) on teak (Tectona grandis) plantations in 20 stands ranging in age from 3 to 20 years have been measured annually for 17 years. We have developed a compatible growth and yield model using the state-space approach and Kopf’s growth equation fitted by nonlinear mixed-effects-models (NLMEMs). For each site index class, the transition function of the basal area depends on the initial basal area (G1) and the initial age (t1), projected to a future basal area (G2) and its age (t2). In the transition function, the previous thinnings were added to not underestimate the total yield. We use NLMEMs to prevent autocorrelation by modeling annual measurements in the PSPs. The transition function is inserted in allometric stand models of three key variables: volume over bark, the volume under bark, and above-ground biomass. Tree allometric models for volume over bark, the volume under bark, and biomass were parameterized, self-validated, independently validated, and recalibrated. Stand allometric models for the same three key variables, as a function of the stand basal area, were parameterized by using NLMEMs to evaluate proportional variance to the mean and variance as a potential function of the mean. In both tree and stand allometric models, the assumptions of the regression have been fulfilled. The resulting growth and yield model allows for the estimation of current growth and predicts future yields in volumes and above-ground biomass arising from thinnings treatments. The proposed model is a useful tool for teak efficient plantations management. The proposed growth models for teak in this paper may have a potential utility in newly teak planted areas, where such tools are scarce or non-existent.},

	abstract = {A prominent feature of comparative life histories is the well documented negative correlation between growth rate and life span. Patterns of resource allocation during growth and reproduction reflect life-history differences between species. This is particularly striking in tropical forests, where tree species can differ greatly in their rates of growth and ages of maturity but still attain similar canopy sizes. Here we provide a theoretical framework for relating life-history variables to rates of production, dM/dt, where M is above-ground mass and t is time. As metabolic rate limits production as an individual grows, dM/dt proportional to M(3/4). Incorporating interspecific variation in resource allocation to wood density, we derive a universal growth law that quantitatively fits data for a large sample of tropical tree species with diverse life histories. Combined with evolutionary life-history theory, the growth law also predicts several qualitative features of tree demography and reproduction. This framework also provides a general quantitative answer to why relative growth rate (1/M)(dM/df) decreases with increasing plant size (proportional to M(-1/4)) and how it varies with differing allocation strategies.},
